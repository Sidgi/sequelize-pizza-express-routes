# HOMEWORK: SEQUELIZE PRACTICE WITH MODELS AND ROUTES

Your instructors has decided to open a pizza restaurant named: Pizza Express!! However, the developer they hired to build the site left it unfinished. Right now it has the beginning of a server, but there's no database attached yet. Oh no!

Your task is to build out the models, seeds, and the routes for the server. Good luck, Developer!

### Setup

- There's a `pacakge.json` provided. Run `npm install` in the directory to install all the dependencies. (Note: The app will not work at this point. Your job is to get it working!).
- Create a database either with `createdb` or `package.json` script commands.
- Build out your `server.js` before you work on the other aspects of your backend. Use the test response route as an initial server response check. Don't add any additional routes until you've build your database!
- Use `npm run dev` to start your server.
- Follow the hints and use what you've learned this week to set up the model.js, seed.js, and resetDb.js.
- Once your database is set up, go back to `server.js`; add a `get` route for `all` the pizzas at `'/pizzas'`, a second `get` route for one pizza at `'/pizzas/:id'`, and a route for `post` a new pizza at `'/pizzas'`.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have a complete `server.js`, `package.json`, `model.js`, `resetDb.js`, `seed.js`.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON SUNDAY NIGHT!! ðŸš¨
